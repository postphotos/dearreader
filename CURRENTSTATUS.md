# Current Status of DearReader Project

This document summarizes the changes and current status of the DearReader project after recent development efforts.

## Python Changes

### Improved Test Coverage
-   **`pytest-cov` Integration:** Successfully integrated `pytest-cov` for comprehensive code coverage reporting in the Python codebase.
-   **Enhanced `py/app.py` Coverage:** Significantly increased test coverage for `py/app.py` by adding new test cases for various command-line arguments and internal functions (`step_npm`, `step_docker`, `step_pyright`, `step_demo`, `step_speedtest`, `step_stop`, `main`, `run_pipeline`). Mocking techniques were extensively used to isolate units and control external interactions (e.g., `run_cmd`, `argparse`, `shutil.which`, `webbrowser.open`, `psutil`).
-   **Enhanced `py/demo.py` Coverage:** Substantially improved test coverage for `py/demo.py`, focusing on the `main` function's argument parsing and the `demo_*` API demonstration functions. External dependencies like `requests` were mocked to ensure reliable and isolated testing.
-   **New Test Files:** Created dedicated test files `py/tests/test_app.py` and `py/tests/test_demo.py` to house the new and expanded test suites.

### Dependency Management
-   **Dedicated Development Environment:** Established a new Python virtual environment (`py/new-venv`) and utilized `requirements-dev.txt` to manage development-specific dependencies, ensuring a clean and reproducible testing setup.

## Javascript Changes

### Test Stability
-   **`jsdomControl` Mocking Fix:** Resolved a `TypeError: this.jsdomControl.snippetToElement is not a function` by correcting the mocking of `jsdomControl` in `js/src/cloud-functions/__tests__/crawler-robots.test.ts`, ensuring tests accurately reflect expected behavior.
-   **AI Test Timeout Resolution:** Addressed persistent test timeouts in `js/src/services/__tests__/pdf-ai-integration.test.ts` by implementing mocking for `AIConsumer.parseText`, preventing real (and rate-limited) API calls to AI providers during testing.

### Robots.txt Parsing
-   **Library Migration:** Replaced problematic `robots-parser` and `robots-txt-parser` libraries with the more robust and compatible `robots` package in `js/package.json` and `js/src/services/robots-checker.ts`. This resolved `SyntaxError` and `TypeError` issues related to module imports and constructor calls.
-   **Test Adaptation:** Updated `js/src/services/__tests__/robots-checker.test.ts` to align with the new `robots` package implementation, ensuring accurate testing of `robots.txt` access rules.

### Coverage Reporting
-   **Node.js V8 Coverage:** Configured Javascript code coverage reporting to leverage Node.js's built-in V8 coverage capabilities, combined with `c8` for generating human-readable reports. This was implemented after encountering compatibility issues with `nyc`.

## TODO: Next Steps to Finish the Task

The immediate next steps involve:
1.  **TODO: Final Verification:** Run all tests (Python and Javascript) one last time to ensure all changes are stable and passing.
2.  **TODO: Review Coverage Reports:** Analyze the generated coverage reports for both Python and Javascript to identify any remaining critical areas with low coverage that might require further attention.
3.  **TODO: Documentation Update:** Review and update project documentation as needed to reflect the changes made and any new features or configurations.
4.  **TODO: Production Readiness:** Perform final checks and configurations to ensure the project is ready for deployment to a production environment.
