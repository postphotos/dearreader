## 🔧 Technical Implementation for Education

### Integration Patterns for Schools

#### 1. Learning Management Systems (LMS)
```javascript
// Moodle/VLE Integration Example
async function getLearningContent(url) {
  const response = await fetch('/' + url, {
    headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
  });
  const content = await response.json();

  // Add to LMS with structured metadata
  return {
    title: content.title,
    content: content.content,
    readingLevel: calculateReadingLevel(content.content),
    learningObjectives: extractObjectives(content.content)
  };
}
```

#### 2. Student Reading Applications
```javascript
// Adaptive reading app integration
function personalizeContent(rawContent, studentLevel) {
  // Use DearReader API to extract clean content
  return fetch('/' + rawContent.url)
    .then(extractSimplified)  // DearReader provides clean text
    .then(adjustVocabulary)  // Adjust to student level
    .then(generateQuestions); // Create comprehension questions
}
```
