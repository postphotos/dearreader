# CLINE_INPROGRESS.md - Cline AI Assistant Progress Report

## 🎯 PROJECT: DearReader LOCAL Crawler - Script Evaluation & Consolidation

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: This is an ENTIRELY LOCAL crawler application! Firebase rules are for future cloud deployment but not currently used.

**Session Started:** 2025-09-07, 4:07 PM (America/Los_Angeles, UTC-7:00)
**Current Mode:** ACT MODE (Implementation Phase)

---

## 📜 RULES - WORKING GUIDELINES

### 🎯 Core Principles
1. **Local-First Approach**: Prioritize local crawler functionality over cloud features
2. **Script Consolidation**: Eliminate redundancy by merging related scripts
3. **Test Everything**: Validate changes work before considering tasks complete
4. **Transparent Progress**: Update task status immediately after completion
5. **Documentation Sync**: Keep README and examples current with code changes

### 🔧 Process Rules
1. **Update Task Status First**: Mark tasks as in-progress, then complete ✓
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Don't complete tasks without verification
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Preserve existing functionality
4. **Error Handling**: Address issues immediately, don't hide them
5. **Code Quality**: Follow existing patterns and conventions

### 🎯 Priority Framework
- 🔥 **CRITICAL**: Blocks core functionality (address immediately)
- 🔴 **HIGH**: Impacts major features (prioritize next)
- 🔵 **MEDIUM**: Enhances usability (schedule appropriately)
- 🟢 **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements (consider time-to-benefit)

### ⏰ Status Update Rules
- **[x] COMPLETED**: Mark ✅ with timestamp when done
- **[ ] IN PROGRESS**: Mark 🔄 when starting
- **[ ] PENDING**: Initial state, not yet started
- **[ ] BLOCKED**: Requires external input or resolution

## ❓ QUESTIONS FOR USER

### 🚨 Critical Questions (Need Answers Before Proceeding)
1. **Firebase Authentication Strategy**: What authentication method will be used?
   - Firebase Auth with email/password?
   - Custom authentication with JWT?
   - Anonymous users allowed?

2. **User Data Model**: What is the user's data structure?
   - How are users identified?
   - What data do users own vs share?

3. **Security Requirements**:
   - Should anonymous users access any data?
   - Admin functionality needed?
   - Public vs private data distinction?

4. **Testing Firebase Access**: Do you want me to test actual Firebase connectivity?
   - I may need your Firebase project credentials
   - Testing will verify the fixes work

### 🔄 Implementation Questions
5. **Script Dependencies**: Are there scripts that depend on dev.sh or setup.sh?
6. **Environment-Specific Config**: Different Firebase projects for dev/staging/prod?
7. **Backwards Compatibility**: Keep old script names or full migration?

## 📋 DETAILED TASK BREAKDOWN

### Critical Firebase Fixes
**UPDATED ANALYSIS** - After reading actual files:

**Firestore Rules Status**: Partial - working for specific collections
- ✅ Working: `/credits/{userId}/`, `/users/{userId}/prompts/`, `/users/{userId}/creditHistory/`
- ❌ Blocked: Everything else by catch-all `match /{document=**} { allow read, write: if false; }`

**Storage Rules Status**: Completely blocked - `allow read, write: if false;`

**Current Firestore Rules**:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /credits/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
    }
    match /users/{userId}/prompts/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
    }
    match /users/{userId}/creditHistory/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
    }
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false; // ❌ BLOCKS EVERYTHING ELSE
    }
  }
}
```

**Plan**: Fix Storage rules first, then expand Firestore rules if needed

- [ ] Install JavaScript dependencies locally via npm
- [ ] Remove node-fetch import completely from puppeteer.ts
- [ ] Perform functional stack trace and code review of server.ts
- [ ] Identify critical dependencies needed for web server startup (express confirmed as critical)

- [ ] Reinstall JavaScript dependencies after Node update (to resolve npm install failures)
- [ ] Determine optimal approach to get server running quickly (update Node.js first, then install deps)
- [ ] Start web server to test focus chain items
- [ ] Update CLINE_INPROGRESS.md with completed tasks
